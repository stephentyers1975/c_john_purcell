/*
 * - Changed particle struct to add new fields.
 * - Separated gs_event_loop into two separate functions, gs_draw and gs_poll_events.
 * - Removed the while loop from gs_poll_events and put it below.
 * - Moved swarm_draw inside the event loop
 *
 * Next:
 * Initialise the particles so that they start at the centre of the screen and have random
 * speed, angular speed and direction.
 * 
 * Add a particle_update function that updates the particle's position based on its speed, 
 * angular speed and direction.
 * 
 * Direction should range from 0 to 2 x PI. Use trig functions to calculate x and y speed
 * based on these values -- or alternatively, scrap that and just try to do something that
 * looks interesting.
 * 
 * Add a swarm_update function that calls particle_update for all the particles and call it
 * in the event loop in main().
 * 
 * Make hue static and increment it during each call to swarm_draw, to gradually change the 
 * color.
 * May need to reset hue to 0 if it becomes greater than 1.
