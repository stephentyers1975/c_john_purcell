/*
 * I changed the scale factor in swarm.c so that both x and y
 * scale the same way, to create a circular explosion.
 * 
 * Added a "back buffer" in graphics.h and graphics.c so that the blur
 * has some memory to work with.
 * 
 * Added graphics_blur(g) in the event loop in main.
 * 
 * Added graphics test code and calling graphics_test_blur() at start of main.
 * 
 * NOTE: I've made vertical_blur and horizontal_blur static, because they shouldn't
 * be called directly outside of the graphic module. They are called by graphics_blur,
 * which isn't static. But some compilers will give incorrect warnings about the
 * two static functions being unused or even not defined.
 * 
 * TODO:
 * 
 * Implement the horizontal_blur and vertical_blur functions in graphics.c so that
 * the tests pass.
 * 
 * Note: use only integer divisions for the divisions, otherwise the tests won't pass.
 *
